## About
I'm a software engineer with over 3 years of technical expertise, coupled with a track record in community service and client-focused roles. I love crafting solutions that resonate with both businesses and their users, especially on projects with social impact. Driven by passion and curiosity, I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning, continually striving to enhance and expand my knowledge. Beyond code, I find solace in nature walks, nurturing my love for California native flora and delving deep into mental health and mindfulness topics. ðŸŒ¾
