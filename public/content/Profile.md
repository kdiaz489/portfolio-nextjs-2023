## About
Hey there. I'm a Software Engineer and a graduate of Smith College with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Studio Art. I have over 3 years of technical experience in full stack development, coupled with a track record in community service and client-focused roles. I love crafting web solutions that resonate with both businesses and their users, especially on projects with social impact. Driven by passion and curiosity, I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning, continually striving to enhance and expand my knowledge. Beyond code, I find solace in long walks, exploring botanical gardens, nurturing my love for California native flora and delving deep into mental health and mindfulness topics. ðŸŒ¾
